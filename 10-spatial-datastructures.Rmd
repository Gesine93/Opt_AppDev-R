# New Chapter: **Spatial Data Structures (see modified chapters)**
- Which packages can enhance **vector data workflow and data structures?**
- What emerging standards (e.g., STDEV, TERRA) **are shaping spatial data structures**?
- How can packages like **`terra`** and **`sfdep`** contribute to spatial data wrangling tasks?
    - **`sfdep`** **:** Investigate the features and benefits of the **`sfdep`** package for spatial data management. Explore how **`sfdep`** data structures compare to traditional methods and how they can optimize spatial data workflows.
    - **TERRA:** Examine the spatial data structure capabilities of the TERRA package. Determine whether TERRA provides a more efficient approach to handling and analyzing large geospatial datasets.
    
    **Compare the data structures of these packages with traditional options like `sf` and other existing solutions**. Consider factors like performance, scalability, and **ease of use while evaluating the "golden standard" for spatial data structures**.
