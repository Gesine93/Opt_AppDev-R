# New Chapter: **Spatial Data Structures (see modified chapters)**

(Basic outline)

In this chapter, we'll delve into the world of spatial data structures in R. We'll explore how to represent, manipulate, and analyze spatial data using state-of-the-art libraries.

## Introduction to Spatial Data
- Definition and types of spatial data: vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster.
- Importance of spatial data in various domains: urban planning, environmental science, transportation, etc.

## Setting Up
- Installing and loading essential packages: sf, terra, sp, raster, and others.

## Simple Features (sf)
- Introduction to the sf package: a modern approach to spatial data in R.
- Creating simple feature objects from vectors and data frames.
- Reading and writing spatial data with sf.
- Basic spatial operations: buffering, overlay, and spatial joins.


## Raster Data with terra
- Introduction to the terra package: a newer and faster approach to raster data.
- Creating, reading, and writing raster data.
- Raster algebra and analysis.
- Conversion between raster and vector data.


## Spatial Visualization ?
- Static maps with ggplot2 and sf. ?
- Interactive maps with mapview and leaflet. ?

## Ideas for Advanced Topics
- Spatial interpolation techniques.
- Spatial regression and statistical analysis.
- Working with large datasets: tips and best practices.

## Exercises and Practical Applications
- Loading and visualizing a real-world spatial dataset, based on ... 
- Performing basic spatial operations and analysis on the dataset ..
- Creating interactive visualizations to explore the data ..
