The R Graph Gallery provides a large number of examples (including code). In this exercise we will conduct some simple statistical analyses and visualize results by means of Histogramms / Bar plots Box plots Scatter plots Line plots 8.1 Visual variables A visual variable is an aspect of a mark that can be controlled to change its appearance. For instance, we can specify different colors to represent a qualitative attribute in a line plot (see Figure 8.1). Figure 8.1: Visual variable volor Visual variables include: Size Shape Orientation Colour (hue) Colour value (brightness) Texture Position (2 dimensions) 8.2 Grammar of graphics Grammars provide rules for languages The grammar of graphics takes us beyond a limited set of charts (words) to an almost unlimited world of graphical forms (statements) (Wilkinson, 2005) Statistical graphic specifications are expressed in six statements: Data manipulation Variable transformations (e.g., rank), Scale transformations (e.g., log), Coordinate system transformations (e.g., polar), Element: mark (e.g., points) and visual variables (e.g., color) Guides (axes, legends, etc.). 8.3 ggplot2 The ggplot2 library offers a series of functions for creating graphics declaratively, based on the Grammar of Graphics. To create a graph in ggplot2: provide the data specify elements which visual variables (aes) which marks (e.g., geom_point) apply transformations guides 8.4 Boxplots x categorical variable y variable to plot geom_boxplot 8.5 Jittered points x categorical variable y variable to plot geom_jitter 8.6 Violin plot x categorical variable y variable to plot geom_violin 8.7 Violin plot 8.8 Lines x e.g., a temporal variable y variable to plot geom_line 8.9 Lines 8.10 Scatterplots x and y variable to plot geom_point 8.11 Overlapping points x and y variable to plot geom_count counts overlapping points and maps the count to size 8.12 Overlapping points 8.13 Bin counts x and y variable to plot geom_bin2d 8.14 Bin counts 8.15 Summary Data visualisation Grammar of graphics ggplot2 Next: Descriptive statistics stat.desc dplyr::across "]]
