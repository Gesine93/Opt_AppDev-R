You will understand that presenting the spatial component of things is important for seeing the richness of information, prompting questions, and offering solutions to problems. The spatial glasses will provide you with a framework to recognise the great variety of spatially referenced problems, and will help you finding approaches for adequate solutions. The remainder of this lesson focuses on geographic space, how we perceive it, and some major theories in Geography that are underlying the discipline of Geoinformatics. 1.1 xxx "]
