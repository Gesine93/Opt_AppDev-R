The R Graph Gallery provides a large number of examples (including code). In this lesson you will get to know the ggplot2 library, which is the most popular library for creating graphics in R. You will learn to create standard graphs such as histograms, boxplots or scatterplots. Furthermore, map making in R will be introduced. 8.1 The Grammar of graphics The ggplot2 library is part of Tidyverse and offers a series of functions for creating graphics declaratively, based on the concepts outlined in the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson. The grammar of graphics is a schema that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. These components are called layers of grammatical elements. Overall the grammar comprises seven layers: Data - The data element is the dataset itself. Aesthetics - This layer defines how variables are mapped onto scales (see description below). Geometries - This element determines how our data is being displayed (bars, points, lines) Facets - Facetting splits the data into subset and displays the same graph for every subset. Statistics - These are statistics derived from the data (add mean, median, quartile). Coordinates - This element determines the transformation of axes (e.g. change spacing of displayed data) Themes - This element determines the graphics background. The aestethics layer offers a number of different options to map data onto visual variables. A visual variable is an aspect of a mark that can be controlled to change its appearance. Visual variables are: Size Shape Orientation Colour (hue) Colour value (brightness) Texture Position (map variable to x or y axis) For instance, in Figure 8.1 variables Gdp per capita and Life Expectancy are mapped onto the x and y axes, variables national population and world regions are mapped onto visual variables size and color. Figure 8.1: Visual variables color and size In order to make that concepts clearer, a number of examples will me presented in upcoming sections. The basic concept behind the grammar of graphics is described in an article by Hadley Wickham. 8.2 ggplot2 The ggplot2 library offers a series of functions for creating graphics declaratively, based on the Grammar of Graphics. To create a graph in ggplot2: provide the data specify elements which visual variables (aes) which marks (e.g., geom_point) apply transformations guides 8.3 Boxplots x categorical variable y variable to plot geom_boxplot 8.4 Jittered points x categorical variable y variable to plot geom_jitter 8.5 Violin plot x categorical variable y variable to plot geom_violin 8.6 Violin plot 8.7 Lines x e.g., a temporal variable y variable to plot geom_line 8.8 Lines 8.9 Scatterplots x and y variable to plot geom_point 8.10 Overlapping points x and y variable to plot geom_count counts overlapping points and maps the count to size 8.11 Overlapping points 8.12 Bin counts x and y variable to plot geom_bin2d 8.13 Bin counts 8.14 Summary Data visualisation Grammar of graphics ggplot2 Next: Descriptive statistics stat.desc dplyr::across "]]
