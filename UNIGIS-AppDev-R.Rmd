## R

Created in 1992 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand

- Free, open-source implementation of *S*
    - statistical programming language 
    - Bell Labs


- Functional programming language
- Supports (and commonly used as) procedural (i.e., imperative) programming
- Object-oriented
- Interpreted (not compiled)



## Interpreting values

When values and operations are inputted in the *Console*, the interpreter returns the results of its interpretation of the expression

```{r, echo=TRUE}
2
"String value"
# comments are ignored
```



## Basic types

R provides three core data types

- numeric 
    - both integer and real numbers
- character 
    - i.e., text, also called *strings*
- logical
    - `TRUE` or `FALSE`


## Numeric operators

R provides a series of basic numeric operators



|Operator|Meaning         |Example  |Output     |
|--------|----------------|---------|-----------|
|+       |Plus            |`5 + 2`  |`r 5 + 2`  |
|-       |Minus           |`5 - 2`  |`r 5 - 2`  |
|`*`     |Product         |`5 * 2`  |`r 5 * 2`  |
|/       |Division        |`5 / 2`  |`r 5 / 2`  |
|%/%     |Integer division|`5 %/% 2`|`r 5 %/% 2`|
|%%      |Module          |`5 %% 2` |`r 5 %% 2` |
|^       |Power           |`5^2`    |`r 5^2`    |



```{r, echo=TRUE}
5 + 2
```



## Logical operators


R provides a series of basic logical operators to test



|Operator|Meaning           |Example           |Output              |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
|==      |Equal             |`5 == 2`          |`r 5 == 2`          |
|!=      |Not equal         |`5 != 2`          |`r 5 != 2`          |
|> (>=)  |Greater (or equal)|`5 > 2`           |`r 5 > 2`           |
|< (<=)  |Less (or equal)   |`5 <= 2`          |`r 5 <= 2`          |
|!       |Not               |`!TRUE`           |`r !TRUE`           |
|&       |And               |`TRUE & FALSE`    |`r TRUE & FALSE`    |
|\|      |Or                |`TRUE | FALSE`    |`r TRUE | FALSE`    |



```{r, echo=TRUE}
5 >= 2
```

# Core concepts

## Recap

**Prev**: An introduction to R

- Basic types
- Basic operators

**Now**: Core concepts

- Variables
- Functions
- Libraries



## Variables

Variables **store data** and can be defined 

- using an *identifier* (e.g., `a_variable`) 
- on the left of an *assignment operator* `<-`
- followed by the object to be linked to the identifier
- such as a *value* (e.g., `1`) 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_variable <- 1
```

The value of the variable can be invoked by simply specifying the **identifier**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_variable
```



## Algorithms and functions

*An* **algorithm** *or effective procedure is a mechanical rule, or automatic method, or programme for performing some mathematical operation* (Cutland, 1980).

A **program** is a specific set of instructions that implement an abstract algorithm.

The definition of an algorithm (and thus a program) can consist of one or more **function**s

- set of instructions that preform a task 
- possibly using an input, possibly returning an output value

Programming languages usually provide pre-defined functions that implement common algorithms (e.g., to find the square root of a number or to calculate a linear regression)



## Functions

Functions execute complex operations and can be invoked 

- specifying the *function name*
- the *arguments* (input values) between simple brackets
    - each *argument* corresponds to a *parameter*
    - sometimes the *parameter* name must be specified

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sqrt(2)
round(1.414214, digits = 2)
```



## Functions and variables

- functions can be used on the right side of `<-` 
- variables and functions can be used as *arguments*

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sqrt_of_two <- sqrt(2)
sqrt_of_two
round(sqrt_of_two, digits = 2)
round(sqrt(2), digits = 2)
```



## Naming

When creating an identifier for a variable or function

- R is a **case sensitive** language
    - UPPER and lower case are not the same
    - `a_variable` is different from `a_VARIABLE`
- names can include
    -  alphanumeric symbols
    - `.` and `_`
- names must start with
    - a letter



## Libraries

Once a number of related, reusable functions are created

- they can be collected and stored in **libraries** (a.k.a. *packages*)
  - `install.packages` is a function that can be used to install libraries (i.e., downloads it on your computer)
  - `library` is a function that *loads* a library (i.e., makes it available to a script)

Libraries can be of any size and complexity, e.g.:

- `base`: base R functions, including the `sqrt` function above
- `rgdal`: implementation of the [GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)](https://gdal.org/) functionalities


## stringr

R provides some basic functions to manipulate strings, but the `stringr` library provides a more consistent and well-defined set

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(stringr)
str_length("Leicester")
str_detect("Leicester", "e")
str_replace_all("Leicester", "e", "x")
```

# Data Types

## Recap

**Prev**: Introduction

- 101 Lecture: Introduction to R
- 102 Lecture: Core concepts
- 103 Lecture: Tidyverse
- 104 Practical session

**Now**: Data types

- vectors
- factors
- matrices, arrays
- lists



## Vectors
**Vectors** are ordered list of values.

- Vectors can be of any data type
    - numeric
    - character
    - logic
- All items in a vector have to be of the same type
- Vectors can be of any length


## Defining vectors

A vector variable can be defined using 

- an **identifier** (e.g., `a_vector`) 
- on the left of an **assignment operator** `<-`
- followed by the object to be linked to the identifier
- in this case, the result returned by the function `c`
- which creates a vector containing the provided elements

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_vector <- c("Birmingham", "Derby", "Leicester",
  "Lincoln", "Nottingham", "Wolverhampton")
a_vector
```

<!--
Note that the second line of the answer provided by R in the console when asking to evaluate the variable starts with `[5]`, as the second line stats with the fifth element of the answer (i.e., the vector)
-->

## Creating vectors

- the operator `:`
- the function `seq`
- the function `rep`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
4:7
seq(1, 7, by = 0.5)
seq(1, 10, length.out = 7)
rep("Ciao", 4)
```


## Selection

Each element of a vector can be retrieved specifying the related **index** between square brackets, after the identifier of the vector. The first element of the vector has index 1.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_vector[3]
```


A vector of indexes can be used to retrieve more than one element.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_vector[c(5, 3)]
```


<!--
## Examples
```{r, echo=TRUE}
east_midlands_cities <- c("Derby", "Leicester", "Lincoln", "Nottingham")
my_indexes <- 2:4
east_midlands_cities[my_indexes]
selected_cities <- c(east_midlands_cities[1], east_midlands_cities[3:4])
```
-->


## Functions on vectors

Functions can be used on a vector variable directly

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_numeric_vector <- 1:5
a_numeric_vector + 10
sqrt(a_numeric_vector)
a_numeric_vector >= 3
```



## Any and all

Overall expressions can be tested using the functions:

- **any**, TRUE if any of the elements satisfies the condition
- **all**, TRUE if all of the elements satisfy the condition

```{r, echo=TRUE}
any(a_numeric_vector >= 3)
all(a_numeric_vector >= 3)
```



## Factors

A **factor** is a data type similar to a vector. However, the values contained in a factor can only be selected from a set of **levels**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
houses_vector <- c("Bungalow", "Flat", "Flat",
  "Detached", "Flat", "Terrace", "Terrace")
houses_vector
houses_factor <- factor(c("Bungalow", "Flat", "Flat",
  "Detached", "Flat", "Terrace", "Terrace"))
houses_factor
```

## table

The function **table** can be used to obtain a tabulated count for each level.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
houses_factor <- factor(c("Bungalow", "Flat", "Flat",
  "Detached", "Flat", "Terrace", "Terrace"))
houses_factor
table(houses_factor)
```

## Specified levels

A specific set of levels can be specified when creating a factor by providing a **levels** argument.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
houses_factor_spec <- factor(
  c("People Carrier", "Flat", "Flat", "Hatchback",
      "Flat", "Terrace", "Terrace"),
  levels = c("Bungalow", "Flat", "Detached",
       "Semi", "Terrace"))
table(houses_factor_spec)
```


## (Unordered) Factors

In statistics terminology, (unordered) factors are **categorical** (i.e., binary or nominal) variables. Levels are not ordered.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
income_nominal <- factor(
  c("High", "High", "Low", "Low", "Low",
      "Medium", "Low", "Medium"),
  levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
```

The *greater than* operator is not meaningful on the `income_nominal` factor defined above

```{r, echo=TRUE}
income_nominal > "Low"
```

## Ordered Factors

In statistics terminology, ordered factors are **ordinal** variables. Levels are ordered.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
income_ordered <- ordered(
  c("High", "High", "Low", "Low", "Low",
      "Medium", "Low", "Medium"),
  levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
income_ordered > "Low"
sort(income_ordered)
```



## Matrices

**Matrices** are collections of numerics arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout

- the first argument is a vector of values
- the second specifies number of rows and columns
- R offers operators and functions for matrix algebra

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_matrix <- matrix(c(3, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1), c(3, 2))
a_matrix
```

<!--
## Matrices
Variables of the type **matrix** are collections of data elements arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. The first argument is vector a containing the values, the second is a vector specifying the number of rows and columns.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- matrix(c(3, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1), c(3, 2))
x
y <- matrix(c(3, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1), c(2, 3))
y
z <- matrix(c(3, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1), c(2, 3), byrow = TRUE)
z
```
## Matrix algebra
Operations as in mathematical matrix algebra.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x
y
z
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
y + z
y %*% x
t(x)
```
## Matrix algebra
Operations as in mathematical matrix algebra.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
A <- matrix(
      c(3, 1, 2, 1),
      nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
A
b <- matrix(
      c(8, 2),
      nrow = 2, ncol = 1)
b
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# inverse
solve(A)
# returns x, where b = Ax
solve(A, b)
# That is
# 8 = 3*4 + 2*-2
# 2 = 1*4 + 1*-2
```
-->

## Arrays

:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.5\textwidth}"}

Variables of the type **array**<br/>are higher-dimensional<br/>matrices.

- the first argument is a<br/>vector containing the<br/>values
- the second argument is<br/>avector specifying the<br/>depth of each dimension

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a3dim_array <- array(1:24, dim=c(4, 3, 2))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
a3dim_array
```
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.5\textwidth}"}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
a3dim_array
```

:::
::::::



<!--
## Matrices and arrays: selection
The subset can be specified as a matrix of indexes.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x2 
choose_x2 <- matrix(
              c(3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3),
              c(4, 2), byrow = TRUE)
choose_x2
x2[choose_x2]
```
-->


## Selection

Subsets of matrices (and arrays) can be selected as seen for vectors.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_matrix[2, c(1, 2)]
a3dim_array[c(1, 2), 2, 2]
```



<!--
## apply
`apply` applies another function to each level of a set dimension of an array
```{r, echo=TRUE}
apply(a3dim_array, 3, min) # apply on third dimension
apply(a3dim_array, 1, min) # apply on first dimension
apply(a3dim_array, 2, min) # apply on second dimension
```
-->



## Lists

Variables of the type **list** can contain elements of different types (including vectors and matrices), whereas elements of vectors are all of the same type. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employee <- list("Stef", 2015)
employee
employee[[1]] # Note the double square brackets for selection
```


## Named Lists

In **named lists** each element has a name, and elements can be selected using their name after the symbol `$`. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employee <- list(employee_name = "Stef", start_year = 2015)
employee
employee$employee_name
```


<!--
## lapply
With `lapply` take care that the function makes sense for *any* element in the list
```{r, echo=TRUE}
various <- list(
  "Some text",
  matrix(c(6, 3, 1, 2), c(2, 2))
)
lapply(various, is.numeric)
```
## Lists: append
The function **append** can be used to append a new element at the end of a list.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
various <- list("Stefano", c(2015, 2016), "Lecturer",
                matrix(c(6, 3, 1, 2), c(2, 2)))
various <- append(various, list(c(7, 6, 9, 1))) 
various
```
-->

# Control structures

## Recap

**Prev**: Data types

- Vectors
- Factors
- Matrices and arrays
- Lists

**Now**: Control structures

- Conditional statements
- Loops



## If

Format: **if** (*condition*) *statement*

- *condition*: expression returning a logic value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)
- *statement*: any valid R statement
- *statement* only executed if *condition* is `TRUE`


```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_value <- -7
if (a_value < 0) cat("Negative")
a_value <- 8
if (a_value < 0) cat("Negative")
```


## Else
Format: **if** (*condition*) *statement1* **else** *statement2*

- *condition*: expression returning a logic value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)
- *statement1* and *statement2*: any valid R statements
- *statement1*  executed if *condition* is `TRUE`
- *statement2*  executed if *condition* is `FALSE`


```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_value <- -7
if (a_value < 0) cat("Negative") else cat("Positive")
a_value <- 8
if (a_value < 0) cat("Negative") else cat("Positive")
```

<!--
## Example
```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- 10
if (is.numeric(x) & (!(x < 0) & (x != 0)) ) cat("greater than zero")
```
-->


## Code blocks

**Code blocks** allow to encapsulate **several** statements in a single group

- `{` and `}` contain code blocks
- the statements are execute together

```{r, echo=TRUE}
first_value <- 8
second_value <- 5
if (first_value > second_value) {
  cat("First is greater than second\n") 
  difference <- first_value - second_value
  cat("Their difference is ", difference)
}
```



## Loops
Loops are a fundamental component of (procedural) programming.


There are two main types of loops:

- **conditional** loops are executed as long as a defined condition holds true
    - construct `while`
    - construct `repeat`
- **deterministic** loops are executed a pre-determined number of times
    - construct `for`


## While

The *while* construct can be defined using the `while` reserved word, followed by the conditional statement between simple brackets, and a code block. The instructions in the code block are re-executed as long as the result of the evaluation of the conditional statement is `TRUE`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
current_value <- 0
while (current_value < 3) {
  cat("Current value is", current_value, "\n")
  current_value <- current_value + 1
}
```

<!--
## Repeat
The *repeat* construct can be defined using the `repeat` reserved word, followed by a code block. The instructions in the code block are re-executed until the command `break` is given. The latter is currently given through an `if` construct, which tests the condition that would stop the loop.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
current_value <- 0
repeat {
  cat("Current value is", current_value, "\n")
  current_value <- current_value + 1
  if (current_value >= 3) break
}
```
## While vs Repeat
The difference between `while` and `repeat` is mostly syntactical.
- Sometimes one or the other might fit better with the algorithm you have in mind
- Use the one that comes easier to you in the given situation
-->

## For

The *for* construct can be defined using the `for` reserved word, followed by the definition of an **iterator**. The iterator is a variable which is temporarily assigned with the current element of a vector, as the construct iterates through all elements of the vector. This definition is followed by a code block, whose instructions are re-executed once for each element of the vector.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cities <- c("Derby", "Leicester", "Lincoln", "Nottingham")
for (city in cities) {
  cat("Do you live in", city, "?\n")
}
```


## For

It is common practice to create a vector of integers on the spot in order to execute a certain sequence of steps a pre-defined number of times.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
for (i in 1:3) {
  cat("This is exectuion number", i, ":\n")
  cat("    See you later!\n")
}
```


## Loops with conditional statements

```{r, echo=TRUE}
3:0
#Example: countdown!
for (i in 3:0) {
  if (i == 0) {
    cat("Go!\n")
  } else {
    cat(i, "\n")
  }
}
```

# Functions

## Summary

**Prev**:Control structures

- Conditional statements
- Loops

**Now**: Functions

- Defining functions
- Scope of a variable



## Defining functions

A function can be defined 

- using an **identifier** (e.g., `add_one`) 
- on the left of an **assignment operator** `<-`
- followed by the corpus of the function

```{r, echo=TRUE}
add_one <- function (input_value) {
  output_value <- input_value + 1
  output_value
  }
```

## Defining functions

The corpus 

- starts with the reserved word `function`
- followed by the **parameter(s)** (e.g., `input_value`) between simple brackets
- and the instruction(s) to be executed in a code block
- the value of the last statement is returned as output

```{r, echo=TRUE}
add_one <- function (input_value) {
  output_value <- input_value + 1
  output_value
  }
```


## Defining functions

After being defined

- a function can be invoked by specifying 
  - the **identifier**
  - the necessary **parameter(s)**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
add_one(3)
add_one(1024)
```


## More parameters

- A function can be defined as having two or more **parameters** 
  - by specifying  more than one parameter name (separated by **commas**) in the function definition
- A function always take as input as many values as the number of parameters specified in the definition
  - otherwise an error is generated

```{r, echo=TRUE}
area_rectangle <- function (hight, width) {
  area <- hight * width
  area
}
area_rectangle(3, 2)
```


## Functions and control structures

Functions can contain both loops and conditional statements

```{r, echo=TRUE}
factorial <- function (input_value) {
  result <- 1
  for (i in 1:input_value) {
    cat("current:", result, " | i:", i, "\n")
    result <- result * i
  }
  result
}
factorial(3)
```


<!--
## Functions and control structures
Factorial using `while`
```{r, echo=TRUE}
factorial <- function (input_value) {
  result <- 1
  while (input_value > 0) {
    cat("current:", result, " | input:", input_value, "\n")
    result <- result * input_value
    input_value <- input_value - 1
  }
  result
}
factorial(3)
```
-->



## Scope

The **scope of a variable** is the part of code in which the variable is ``visible''
In R, variables have a **hierarchical** scope:
- a variable defined in a script can be used referred to from within a definition of a function in the same script
- a variable defined within a definition of a function will **not** be referable from outside the definition
- scope does **not** apply to `if` or loop constructs
## Example
In the case below
- `x_value` is **global** to the function `times_x`
- `new_value` and `input_value` are **local** to the function `times_x`
    - referring to `new_value` or `input_value` from outside the definition of `times_x` would result in an error
```{r, echo=TRUE}
x_value <- 10
times_x <- function (input_value) {
  new_value <- input_value * x_value
  new_value
}
times_x(2)
```
<!--
Hint: try *debug* the function above and observe how the *local* environment is created and then discarded
-->


<!--
# Debugging
## What is debugging?
- Hardly any reasonably sized function works first time!
- Two broad kinds of problem
    - The function crashes (i.e. throws up an error)
    - The function doesn't crash  but returns the wrong answer
    - Generally, the second kind of error is the worst
- Prevention is better than cure, test the code as you write.
- **Debugging** is the process of finding the problems in the code.
- A typical approach
    - `Step' through the function line by line.  Find out where a crash occurs,  if one does.
    - Check the values of variables, and see if they are doing what they are supposed to.
- R has tools to help with this.
## To debug a function
- Enter `debug( <<Function Name>> )`
- For example: `debug(area.tri)`
- Then just use the function - it goes into 'debug mode'.
- Prompt becomes `Browse>`
- Line of function about to be executed is listed
- Pressing return executes it and goes to the next line
- Typing in a variable name lists the value of that variable
- Typing in any other command executes that command
- Typing in `c` and the return runs to the end of a function/block
- Typing in `Q` exits the function
- R can `see' variables that are specific to the function
- Enter `undebug(<<Function Name>>)` to return to normal
## Example
Debug the following example
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
percentage_change <- function (before, after){
  difference <- before - after
  prop_change <- difference / before
  perc_change <- prop_change * 100
  perc_change
```

# Data frames

## Recap

**Prev**: R programming

- 111 Lecture: Data types
- 112 Lecture: Control structures
- 113 Lecture: Functions
- 114 Practical session

**Now**: Data Frames

- Data Frames
- Tibbles


## Lists and named lists

**List**

- can contain elements of different types
  - whereas elements of vectors are all of the same type
- in **named lists**, each element has a name
  - elements can be selected using the operator `$`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employee <- list(employee_name = "Stef", start_year = 2015)
employee[[1]]
employee$employee_name
```



## Data Frames

A **data frame** is equivalent to a *named list* where all elements are *vectors of the same length*.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employees <- data.frame(
  EmployeeName = c("Maria", "Pete", "Sarah"),
  Age = c(47, 34, 32),
  Role = c("Professor", "Researcher", "Researcher"))
employees
```

Data frames are the most common way to represent tabular data in R. Matrices and lists can be converted to data frames.

<!--
**Note:** As is common in R, the elements of an eventual too short column are recycled to match column lengths.
-->

## Selection

Selection is similar to vectors and lists.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employees[1, 1] # value selection
employees[1, ] # row selection
employees[, 1] # column selection
```


## Selection

Selection is similar to vectors and lists.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employees$EmployeeName # column selection, as for named lists
employees$EmployeeName[1]
```



## Table manipulation

- Values can be assigned to cells
  - using any selection method 
  - and the assignment operator `<-`
- New columns can be defined 
  - assigning a vector to a new name

```{r, echo=TRUE}
employees$Age[3] <- 33 
employees$Place <- c("Leicester", "Leicester","Leicester") 
employees
```



## Column processing

Operations can be performed on columns as they where vectors

```{r, echo=TRUE}
10 - c(1, 2, 3)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Use Sys.Date to retrieve the current year
current_year <- as.integer(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))
# Calculate employee year of birth
employees$Year_of_birth <- current_year - employees$Age
employees
```



## tibble

A [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) is a modern reimagining of the data.frame within `tidyverse`

- they do less 
    - donât change column names or types
    - donât do partial matching
- complain more
    - e.g. when referring to a column that does not exist
    
That forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.

# Selection and filtering

## Recap

**Prev**: Data Frames

- Data Frames
- Tibbles

**Now**: Data selection and filtering

- dplyr
- dplyr::select
- dplyr::filter



## dplyr

The `dplyr` (pronounced *dee-ply-er*) library is part of `tidyverse` and it offers a grammar for data manipulation

- `select`: select specific columns
- `filter`: select specific rows
- `arrange`: arrange rows in a particular order
- `summarise`: calculate aggregated values (e.g., mean, max, etc)
- `group_by`: group data based on common column values
- `mutate`: add columns
- `join`: merge tables (`tibbles` or `data.frames`)

<!--
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
-->


## Example dataset

The library `nycflights13` contains a dataset storing data about all the flights departed from New York City in 2013

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
nycflights13::flights
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  print(n= 3, width = 70)
```



## Selecting table columns

Columns of **data frames** and **tibbles** can be selected

- specifying the column index

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights[, c(13, 14)]
```

- specifying the column name

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights[, c("origin", "dest")]
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights[, c("origin", "dest")] %>% 
  print(n = 3)
```



## dplyr::select

`select` can be used to specify which columns to retain

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dplyr::select( 
    origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, year:day
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dplyr::select( 
    origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, year:day
  ) %>% 
  print(n = 5)
```


## dplyr::select

... or whichones to drop, using - in front of the column name

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dplyr::select(origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, year:day) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-arr_delay)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dplyr::select(
    origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, year:day
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    -arr_delay
  ) %>% 
  print(n = 3)
```


## Logical filtering

Conditional statements can be used to filter a vector

- i.e. to retain only certain values
- where the specified value is `TRUE`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_numeric_vector <- -3:3
a_numeric_vector
a_numeric_vector[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```



## Conditional filtering

As a conditional expression results in a logic vector...

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_numeric_vector > 0
```

<br/>
... conditional expressions can be used for filtering

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a_numeric_vector[a_numeric_vector > 0]
```



## Filtering data frames

The same approach can be applied to **data frames** and **tibbles**

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights$month
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
capture.output(nycflights13::flights$month)[1] %>% str_trunc(52) %>% cat()
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights$month == 11
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
capture.output(nycflights13::flights$month == 11)[1] %>% str_trunc(52) %>% cat()
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights[nycflights13::flights$month == 11, ]
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights[nycflights13::flights$month == 11, ] %>% 
  print(n = 1, width = 52)
```



## dplyr::filter

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  # Flights in November
  dplyr::filter(month == 11)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dplyr::filter(month == 11) %>%
  print(n = 3, width = 52)
```




## Select and filter

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  # Select the columns you need
  dplyr::select(origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, year:day) %>% 
  # Drop arr_delay... because you don't need it after all
  dplyr::select(-arr_delay) %>%
  # Filter in only November flights
  dplyr::filter(month == 11)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
nycflights13::flights %>%
  dplyr::select(origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, year:day) %>%
  dplyr::select(-arr_delay) %>%
  dplyr::filter(month == 11) %>%
  print(n = 3, width = 52)
```
