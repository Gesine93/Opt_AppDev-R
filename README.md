# UNIGIS Salzburg: Application Development - Scripting with R

These learning materials are designed for the UNIGIS distance-learning study programs as part of a module that introduces into Application Development. 

The contents of this module are based on [granolarr](https://sdesabbata.github.io/granolarr/), a *geogGRaphic dAta scieNce, reprOducibLe teAching resouRce in R* by Stefano De Sabbata, University of Leicester. 

In this module, the granolarr materials will be adapted and extended to fit the UNIGIS curriculum and layout of materials. Like the source materials, this work is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).


ToDos:

* add long and wide table formats (see data wrangling de sabbata)
* spatial data wrangling as new lesson
* add raw and complex as additional simple data types, see [pull request Gabriel Gaona](https://github.com/UNIGIS-Salzburg/Opt_AppDev-R/pulls)
* new tidymodels library for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles, new lesson on machine learning


## Interesting API-Call's (if the OpenWeather API has some issues in the near future.)

https://api.nasa.gov/ #free to use - API-keys, that need different parameters.
