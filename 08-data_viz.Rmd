# Data visualisation

R has a very rich set of graphical functions. The [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/){target="_blank"} provides a large number of examples (including code).  

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
In this lesson you will get to know the [`ggplot2` library](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}, which is the most popular library for creating graphics in R. You will learn to create standard graphs such as histograms, boxplots or scatterplots. Furthermore, map making in R will be introduced. 
```

## The Grammar of Graphics

The [ggplot2 library](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} is part of [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} and offers a series of functions for creating graphics declaratively, based on the concepts outlined in the Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson.

The grammar of graphics is a schema that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. These components are called **layers of grammatical elements.** Overall the grammar comprises seven layers:

1) Data - The data element is the dataset itself.
2) Aesthetics - This layer defines how variables are mapped onto scales (see description below).
3) Geometries - This element determines how our data is being displayed (bars, points, lines)
4) Facets - Facetting splits the data into subset and displays the same graph for every subset.
5) Statistics - These are statistics derived from the data (add mean, median, quartile, etc.).
6) Coordinates - This element determines the transformation of axes (e.g. change spacing of displayed data)
7) Themes - This element determines the graphics background.

The **aestethics layer** offers a number of different options to map data onto visual variables. A **visual variable** is an aspect of a **mark** that can be controlled to change its appearance.

Visual variables are: 

- Size
- Shape 
- Orientation
- Colour (hue)
- Colour value (brightness)
- Texture
- Position (map variable to x or y axis) 

For instance, in Figure \@ref(fig:L07-colsize) variables 'Gdp per capita' and  'Life Expectancy' are mapped onto the x and y axes (visual variable **position**), variables 'national population' and 'world regions' are mapped onto visual variables **size** and **color**.

```{r L07-colsize, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual variables color and size", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/VisualVar.png')
```

In order to make that concepts clearer, a number of examples will me presented in upcoming sections.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
The basic concept behind the grammar of graphics is described in an [article](https://byrneslab.net/classes/biol607/readings/wickham_layered-grammar.pdf){target="_blank"} by Hadley Wickham.  
```

## Visualization of distributions

As already announced above, functions in the `ggplot2` library are structured according to the Grammar of Graphics. To create a graph in `ggplot2`, we need to provide input data, specify visual variables by means of an aesthetics element (`aes()`), specify the geometry of marks (e.g., `geom_point`) and apply transformations (axis spacing) and themes (background theme of the graph).

We start the analysis with a simple histogram, to explore the distribution of air quality [data](data/AirQualityUpperAut.csv){target="_blank"} that has been measured at different locations in Upper Austria.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

The data includes the following **variables**

- **time** of measurement
- ID of the measuring **station**
- measured meteorological [**component**](data/MetadataAirqual.xlsx){target="_blank"}
- [**meantype**](data/MetadataAirqual2.xlsx){target="_blank"}
- **unit** of measurement
- measurement **value**
  
```

The following code renders the first five lines of the dataset in a `knitr` table:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4}

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

#read csv data, Note: Semicolon seperated CSVs can be loaded by function 'read_delim()'
airquality <- read_delim("data/AirQualityUpperAut.csv", delim = ";")

airquality %>%
  dplyr::slice_head(n = 5) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

The code below filters the airquality datset by measurement component and temporal resolution. Then the data subset is passed as a first argument to function `ggplot()`. In the second argument, we map the variable 'value' onto the x-axis with the aesthetics argument `aes()`. `geom_histogram()` specifies the geometry of the plot and `theme_bw()` is used to add a [background theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html){target="_blank"}.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4}

#filter NO2 measurements with temporal resolution 30min (HMW)
airquality %>%
  dplyr::filter(component == "NO2" & meantype == "HMW") %>%

  #create plot  
  ggplot2::ggplot(.,    #the dot '.' represents the piped value 
    aes(            
      x = value         #map variable 'value' onto x-axis
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram() +    #define geometry
  ggplot2::theme_bw()            #define theme

```

If we aim to distinguish between measurements of respective measurement stations, we can map the variable 'station' onto visual variable color:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4}

airquality %>%
  dplyr::filter(component == "NO2" & meantype == "HMW") %>%
  dplyr::filter(station == "S125" | station == "S431" | station == "S270") %>%    #select 3 stations

  ggplot2::ggplot(.,    
    aes(            
      x = value, 
      fill = station
      
    )
  ) +
  
  ggplot2::xlab("NO2 [mg/m^3]") +
  ggplot2::ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Measurement stations", values = c("grey20", "grey50", "grey80")) +
  ggplot2::geom_histogram() +   
  ggplot2::theme_bw()            

```

This is implemented by adding an attribute `fill = station` to the aesthetics element (`aes()`). `ggplot2` offers a number of [functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_colour_fill_alpha.html){target="_blank"} to specify your own set of mappings from levels in the data to aesthetic values. In the example above the function `scale_fill_manual()` is used to map the three levels S125, S270 and S431 to the [predefined ggplot colors](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour){target="_blank"} grey20, grey50 and grey80. Instead of ggplot colors, you can also use [hex color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/){target="_blank"}.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Note that plot components are [added](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/gg-add.html){target="_blank"} by means of a plus '+' sign. It allows you to start simple, then get more and more complex.

So far we have added two axis labels. Create a new R-Script, download the [input data](data/AirQualityUpperAut.csv){target="_blank"}, recreate the histogram and insert one additional line of code to add a plot title (see [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html){target="_blank"}).

</details>

```

## Boxplots

The same basic syntax is used to create other types of plots like bar plots (use geometry [`geom_bar()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html){target="_blank"} or [`geom_col()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html){target="_blank"}), line plots (use geometry [`geom_line()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_path.html){target="_blank"}) and many [others](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html){target="_blank"}.

For instance, if we replace `geom_histogram()` by `geom_boxplot()`, the value distribution of NO2 measurements is visualized by means of a box plot:   

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4}

#filter NO2 measurements with temporal resolution 30min (HMW)
airquality %>%
  dplyr::filter(component == "NO2" & meantype == "HMW") %>%

  #create plot  
  ggplot2::ggplot(.,    #the dot '.' represents the piped value 
    aes(            
      x = value         #map variable 'value' onto x-axis
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::xlab("NO2 [mg/m^3]") +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot() +    #define geometry
  ggplot2::theme(
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),    #remove text and ticks from y axis
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )

```

Note that the last two lines remove text and tick marks from the y-axis of the plot.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

Just as historamms, box plots are used to inspect distributions in data. The [interpretation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html){target="_blank"}, however, does require some additional information.  

The lower and upper edge of the box (the so called lower and upper **hinges**) correspond to the first and third [quartiles](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/what-are-quartiles/){target="_blank"}. The vertical line that seperates the box, indicates the **median** value (second quartile). 

The upper **whisker** extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called "outlying" points and are plotted individually.

```

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

In our histogram examples, we have mapped the variable ‘station’ onto visual variable color to seperately visualize measurements of different stations. Try to apply the same approach to render mesurements of stations S125, S270 and S431 seperately in a box plot. 
                                                                        
See [my solution](Solution_Exercise_boxplots.R){target="_blank"}!                                                                           
```

## Scatterplots

While boxplots and histograms reveal distributions in data, scatterplots are used to illustrate relationships between variables. 

In the following example, air temperature (TEMP) and relative humidity (RF) measured in a 30min interval by station ‘S108‘ are filtered from data table ‘airquality‘. Then the two tables are joined by their common field ‘time‘. The joined table is used as data input to render a scatterplot with temperature on the x-axis and relative humidity on the y-axis.   

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 4}

#half-hourly temperature measurement of station S108 to data frame
temp_tab <- airquality %>%
  dplyr::filter(component == "TEMP" & meantype == "HMW" & station == "S108") 

#half-hourly relative humidity measurement of station S108 to data frame
humidity_tab <- airquality %>%
  dplyr::filter(component == "RF" & meantype == "HMW" & station == "S108") 

#join humidity and temperature tables by common field 'time'
temp_tab %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(
  # right table
  humidity_tab,
  # columns to match
  by = c("time" = "time")
  ) %>%
  
  dplyr::select(time, value.x, value.y) %>%   #select relevant columns from joined table

  #create plot  
  ggplot2::ggplot(.,    
    aes(            
      x = value.x,      
      y = value.y
    )
  ) +
  ggplot2::xlab("air temperature [°C]") +
  ggplot2::ylab("relative humidity [%]") +
  ggplot2::geom_point(color="blue")  +                                      #define geometry scatterplot, with point color blue
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method=lm , color="red", fill="#69b3a2", se=TRUE) +  #with linear trend and confidence interval
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()               

```

The plot reveals a trend between the two variables temperature and humidity. Relative humidity tends to increase as temperature decreases and vice versa. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saojnBSBUuk){target="_blank"} you can find an explanation for the inverse proportional relationship between relative humidity and air temperature.

Obviously, due to other predictors such as windspeed, evaporation etc., this relationship is not perfectly linear, however, it can be closely approximated by means of a linear regression line. Deviations from the linear model are indicated by a 95% confidence interval.  

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Copy and run the code example from above in a new R-Script. Note that the air quality data as well as the `tidyverse` library must be loaded to run the code in a standalone R-script file.

Go through the code example line by line and answer the following questions:
  
1) How many measurements (records) are included in the scatterplot?
2) What is value.x and value.y?
3) We have used  the function `geom_smooth()` to fit a linear regresison model (method = lm). What is the purpose of argument `se`?

1) Measurements between 21.10.2021 14:00 and 22.10.2021 12:00, half-hourly interval -> 45 records (see envoronment tab in RStudio)
2) temperature and humidity values in the data frame tables `humidity_tab` and `temp_tab` are both denoted `value`. In order to avoid ambiguities, the join functions renames columns.
3) The argument defines whether confidence bounds are diplayed (`se` is TRUE by default).
