# RMarkdown

This lesson is dedicated to the library `rmarkdown`. In fact, however, Rmarkdown is more than only a library. [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} belongs to a set of tools that are designed to improve the reproducibility of your work. Other tools and platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/){target="_blank"}, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){target="_blank"} or preprint servers such as [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/){target="_blank"} or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/){target="_blank"} facilitate reproducibility in many different ways. In this module, we will not cover the full paradigm of [reproducible research](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1801){target="_blank"}. Instead, we will focus on those aspects that will helping you make your analyses and reports more appealing, interactive and efficient.
