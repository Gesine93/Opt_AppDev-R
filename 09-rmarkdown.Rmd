# R Markdown

This lesson is dedicated to the library `rmarkdown`. In fact, however, R Markdown is **more than only a library**. [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} belongs to a set of tools that are designed to improve the reproducibility of your work. Other tools and platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/){target="_blank"}, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){target="_blank"} or preprint servers such as [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/){target="_blank"} or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/){target="_blank"} facilitate reproducibility in many different ways. In this module, we will not cover the paradigm of [reproducible research](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1801){target="_blank"} in detail. Instead, we will focus on those aspects that will helping you **make your analyses and reports** more appealing, interactive and **efficient**.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

In this lesson, we will weave together code and text in professionally rendered R Markdown documents. And we will use [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} to safely store, share and administer our results.    

```

## Set up your work environment

Before you will create your first R Markdown document, we have to **setup** the **GitHub** environment. GitHub was originally founded as a platform for software developers. The architecture of GitHub is designed to manage changes that are made to computer software in the process of software development. The same architecture, however, can also be used to control the versioning of documents or any other collection of information.

Version control is particularly important when working in teams to sync working steps among project participants. However, even when working individually, GitHub is a trustworthy and open online data dump that tracks changes and simplifies the documentation and sharing of your work and others.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

To setup your personal GitHub environment, follow these steps:

1) Read through the [Hello-World-Section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world){target="_blank"} of GitHub's Quickstart Documentation. For now, reading is fine. You do not necessarily have to work through the tutorial.  
2) [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}.
3) [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target="_blank"}. [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git){target="_blank"} it is a distributed VCS (version control system), in which the codebase aswell as it's full history is mirrored on every computer. GitHub therefore, is a web-based interface that uses Git very well. If you are interested in its theory and practice, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR6G2v_WsRA){target="_blank"} gives a very nice explanation of core concepts in Git.
4) Open R Studio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Git / SVN: check "enable version control" and set the path to the git.exe (e.g. C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe). Restart RStudio.
5) [Create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo){target="_blank"} on GitHub. In the tutorial,  Skip section 'Commit your first changes'. 
6) By default, your repository has one branch named `main`. Create an additional branch off the `main` and call this new branch `dev`. To do so, follow the instructions in the [Hello-World-Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world){target="_blank"}.

```

As next step, you will have to install the `rmarkdown` library as well as `tinytex` in RStudio as described in the [R Markdown Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html){target="_blank"}.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

In order to correctly **install**`tinytex`, make sure to execute both lines in RStudio:
  
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

If R Studio prompts you to install any dependencies, follow the instructions and install the necessary libraries. If you encounter any technical issues, please turn to the discussion forum for help.

## Create a local clone

To work on your repository locally, you will need to create a local clone of your online GitHub repository. Here's how:

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

In RStudio: File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> Git.

Copy and paste the repository URL (you can find this by going to your online repository), browse to the local directory and click: `Create Project` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-clone)).

```

```{r L09-clone, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Clone GitHub Repository", out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Gitclone.png')
```

Once you have cloned the online repository, the file contents of the repository as well as a new tab called `Git` appears in RStudio (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-features)).

```{r L09-features, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="New features in RStudio", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/NewFeatures.png')
```

Per default the repository contains three files:

1)  [`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore){target="_blank"}
2)  An [RStudio Project File](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects){target="_blank"} (.Rproj)
3)  A [ReadMe File](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes){target="_blank"} (.md = pure markdown)

[`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore){target="_blank"} and the [RStudio Project File](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects){target="_blank"} were created on project initialization, meaning that these files are new and not yet available in the online repository. Changes made to the original repository are listed in the `Git tab` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-changes)).

```{r L09-changes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Changes in Git tab", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Changes.png')
```

Before we further modify our repository, switch to the `dev` branch (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-branch)). At the moment `dev` branch and `main` branch **are identical**.

```{r L09-branch, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Switch branch", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Branches.png')
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

It his **highly recommended** to keep work in progress separate from the `main` branch by working in a separate developer branch. Later, branches may be unified by merging from `dev` into the `main` branch (see [Opening a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#opening-a-pull-request){target="_blank"}).

```

## Create a first RMarkdown document

Now that the environment is set up, we can create a first simple R Markdown document.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

In RStudio: File -> New File -> R Markdown....

Type in a title, keep the default settings and confirm with `OK`. As a result you get a minimal R Markdown sample file, with the file extension `.Rmd`.

```

As apparent from the sample file, R Markdown documents are composed of the three basic components **metadata**, **text** and **code** (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-sample)).

```{r L09-sample, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R Markdown sample file", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/SampleFile.png')
```

The syntax for the metadata is [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML){target="_blank"}. In our document, the metadata section specifies the title of the document, the output format, and the date of creation. Many other document properties can be specified in this section. [Here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ymlthis/vignettes/yaml-overview.html){target="_blank"} you can find an **overview** of the basic YAML syntax.

You can also update the date automatically to reflect the last time the report was updated by adding this simple code to the metadata section:   `format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`. This will output the current date in a human-readable format based on your systems time zone.

After the metadata section an **R inline code block** starts and ends with backticks (\`). The three **parameters** in curly brackets identify the code as R code. The `r` specifies the programming language, which is the default for R. But for example, You can also use{py}for Python (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-python)). or see a list of supported programming languages by running: `names(knitr::knit_engines\$get())`. The `setup` is the name of the code block (also called code chunk) and (as we will see later) `include=FALSE` prevents the code and code results of this code block from being displayed in the compiled HTML output. Nevertheless, R Markdown still runs the code in this block. The **inline code block** as such **sets** `echo=TRUE` as the default option for all code chunks in the document. This means that, by default, the code of all code chunks in the document will be displayed in the output file unless otherwise indicated. If you want to know more about **knitr** and "fine-tune" its behavior when processing chunks. Please refer to this [documentation](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/){target="_blank"}

```{r L09-python, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Python Example", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pyexample.png')
```

The other code blocks in the `.Rmd` document produce a summary output (see line 7-19) or create a simple scatterplot (see line 25-27). To see how the compiled HTML output looks like, click `Knit` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-knit)).

```{r L09-knit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Knit HTML Output ", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/knit.png')
```

You can also use the dropdown arrow next to the **Knit** button to compile PDF or .docx outputs, or choose from the [other](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html){target="_blank"} supported formats.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Please take your time to understand how the `.Rmd` syntax translates into an output. For instances, to bold text, you can add two asterisks before and after a word or phrase.  

```

## Synchronize with GitHub

It's good practice to **synchronize** changes made to the project **regularly** with the online repository. First, you need to pull any changes that someone else may have made.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Click the `Pull button` in the `Git tab` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-pull)). A message appears indicating that no other changes have been made (`Already up to date`).

```

```{r L09-pull, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Make Pull", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pull.png')
```

Even if you're working on your own, it's a good idea to routinely start the sync process with a `Pull`.

Before you can push your own changes to the online repository, you have to `Commit` changes. Committing is like in-process saving. The `Commit` takes a snapshot of your changes and combines it with a user-defined commit message.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Save all documents in R Studio, then click the "Commit" button in the Git tab. The files that have been affected by changes will be listed in the commit window. You can click on one of the files to see the changes (green represents new content, red represents deleted content).

Manually select all the files by clicking the corresponding checkboxes. To make sure you have not missed a file, you may execute `git add -A` in the terminal window to add all files to the commit (see [this](https://github.com/joshnh/Git-Commands){target="_blank"} list of popular Git Commands.) Once this is done, enter a meaningful commit message that describes your revision and click the `Commit button`. 

See Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-commit)

```

```{r L09-commit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Make Commit", out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/commit.png')
```
&nbsp;

To finish the sync process, click the `Push button` in the `Git tab` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-push)).


```{r L09-push, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Make Push", out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Push.png')
```
&nbsp;

Your online repository on GitHub should now be updated (switch to `dev` branch in your repository) (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-updated)).

```{r L09-updated, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Commit with message 'decribe sync process in github' was pushed to the developer branch a minute ago", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/CommitFinished.png')
```

## Basic R Markdown syntax

In R Markdown documents, you can use double asterisks (`**Text**`) to **bold** words and phrases, or single asterisks (`*Text*`) to *italicize* them.

You can also create headings using hash signs (#). The number of hash signs you use corresponds to the heading level (up to 6):


    # Heading level 1

    ## Heading level 2

    ### Heading level 3


Do you remember in the first chapter, the numeric operators table? 
Tables are made by using the symbol | and - like this:

```{r L09-tables, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="How Tables are made in Markdown", out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tables.png')
```

To create an **ordered list**, use numbers followed by a period. The first item should start with the number 1:
    
    Code - Ordered List:
    1. item 1
    4. item 2
    3. Item 3
        + Item 3a
        + Item 3b

1. Item 1
4. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b


To create an **unordered list**, use *, -, or +:
    
    Code - Unordered List:
    * item 1
    * item 2
      * Item 3.1
      - Item 3.2

* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    - Item 2b

A very important thing to know are providing **hyperlinks**, first you surround links in [] brackets and then the link target in () parantheses, `{target="_blank}` is optional. But it will open a new browser tab like this:

    Code - \[Github](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}

[Github](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}

Now you might ask yourself if we want to use a \# for example. But not for a header. How can we tell Markdown to **ignore these special characters**? This works with an **\(\) backslash**. Simply, put the backslash before your **special character**. The backslash sign then gets ignored and you will see the specific sign. 

If you need to write a scientific paper and need to proof something. you will also oftentimes need **mathematical formula**. These are based on LaTeX - you will find more formulas [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics){target="_blank"}. You can call these by using the "\$" icon before and after writing, this will create an **inline equation**. A Double "\$$" icon means its a **display equation**. They come in very handy.

$Z =\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right) inline$
$$Z =\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right) display$$
&nbsp;

```{r L09-mathequations, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Math Equations in RMarkdown", out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/mathequations.png')
```

R Markdown also comes with a time-saving method to insert **citations** and to build a **bibliography**. References are collected in a .bib-file that resides in the RStudio Project folder. For example, you can create a new document in a text editor such as Windows Editor, save the file with a **.bib** extension (e.g. references.bib), and then place it in the same folder as your RStudio project.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

You can use the RStudio project that you have cloned, modified and synchronized in previous exercises.

```

Now you can **add references** to the .bib-file. References are encoded in BibTeX format. The easiest way to get the BibTeX description of a reference is to export from Google Scholar. To enable BibTeX export, change setting in Google Scholar (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-scholarsettings)).

```{r L09-scholarsettings, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Enable BibTeX in Firefox 106.0.1", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/ScholarSettings.png')
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
You may use a different browser or version of Firefox. In case you need support, please turn to the discussion forum!
```

Once you have enabled BibTeX export in your browser, a new link `Import into BibTeX` appears in Google Scholar (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-biboption)).

```{r L09-biboption, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="BibTeX Link in Firefox 106.0.1", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/bibtexoption.png')
```

Click the link and copy & paste the BibTeX code into your .bib-file.

Now you can use the reference in your R Markdown file by specifying the name of the .bib-file as YAML metadata. You can add multiple BibTeX references to the .bib-file. The syntax to embedded references in text is approached by using the \@ character, `@<first BibTeX parameter` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-refs)).

```{r L09-refs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Integrate BibTeX reference in RMarkdown document", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/refs.png')
```

To compile your R Markdown document, `knit` as HTML, PDF or Word. The `rmarkdown` library renders references as indirect citations (*reference without squared brackets in .Rmd file*) and direct citations (*reference with squared brackets in .Rmd file*) and inserts a bibliography (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-pdfknit)).

```{r L09-pdfknit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Knit R Markdown as PDF", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/knit_pdf.png')
```

[Here](%22data/ReferencesInRMarkdown.zip%22){target="_blank"} you can find a worked example for download. Unzip the folder and open the .Rproj file in RStudio.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
Other helpful R Markdown syntax examples can be looked up in the [RMarkdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf){target="_blank"}.
```

## Speed up your workflows

Many of the methods that were covered in this module ***are intended to make repetitive workflows more efficient** and less time-consuming. In this section, an example is introduced that illustrates the great potentials of R Markdown in terms of automation and efficiency improvement.

Imagine you have a client who is interested in a specific set of spatial economic indicators that are updated daily. Rather than creating a data report from scratch every day, R Markdown allows you to create a data report with charts that are automatically generated on report compilation. This can save you a significant amount of time and effort, and allow you to focus on other tasks.

Data can be retrieved in real-time by means of [Alpha Ventage](https://www.alphavantage.co/){target="_blank"}. Alpha Ventage provides financial market data through the [Alpha Ventage Rest API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/){target="_blank"}. To access the API in R, we can use the R library [`alphaventager`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/alphavantager/index.html){target="_blank"}.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

In this exercise you are provided with a first draft version of the finance data report. [Download](data/RMarkdownFinanceData.zip){target="_blank"} the draft version. Unzip the folder and open the .Rproj file in RStudio. 

The project includes a .bib file that contains a BibTeX reference, a .csv file (see folder data) with more than 400 country names, national currencies and currency codes and an .Rmd file with inline R code that renders real-time currency exchange in a map.

Carefully read through the .Rmd file **before you compile an HTML output**.

Important: The .Rmd file includes an interactive leaflet map, i.e. other outputs than HTML are not supported.

Once you have understood the structure of this document, try to supplement the finance data report with an additional spatial indicator (e.g. map of exchange rates from national currencies to Euro).

```


## Self-study

The functionality of R Markdown is comprehensive and **cannot be covered** in one lesson. It is highly recommended to consult the online book [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/){target="_blank"} to leverage the full potential of R Markdown.

Other R Markdown compile formats that are described in this book are Notebooks and Presentations. As mentioned in the Python example, RMarkdown also supports other languages such as Python, C++ and SQL. It can also be customized and used to create more complex documents with extensions like: [BookDown](https://bookdown.org/){target="_blank"} or [ThesisDown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown){target="_blank"}. It is **recommended to practice and experiment** with these different features to become proficient in using R Markdown.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}
By the way, this module is written in BookDown\!
