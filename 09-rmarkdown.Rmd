# RMarkdown

This lesson is dedicated to the library `rmarkdown`. In fact, however, Rmarkdown is more than only a library. [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} belongs to a set of tools that are designed to improve the reproducibility of your work. Other tools and platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/){target="_blank"}, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){target="_blank"} or preprint servers such as [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/){target="_blank"} or [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/){target="_blank"} facilitate reproducibility in many different ways. In this module, we will not cover the paradigm of [reproducible research](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1801){target="_blank"} in detail. Instead, we will focus on those aspects that will helping you make your analyses and reports more appealing, interactive and efficient.

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

In this lesson, we will weave together code and text in professionally rendered Rmarkdown documents. And we will use [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} to savely store, share and administer our results.    

```

## Set up your work environment

Before you will create your first Rmarkdown document, we have to setup the GitHub environment. GitHub was originally founded as a platform for software developers. The architecture of GitHub is designed to manage changes that are made to computer software in the process of software development. The same architecture, however, can also be used to control the versioning of documents or any other collection of information.

Version control is particularly important when working in teams to sync working steps among project participants. However, even when working individually, GitHub is a trustworthy and open online data dump that tracks changes and simplifies the documentation and sharing of your work.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

To setup your personal GitHub environment, follow these steps:

1) Read through the [Hello-World-Section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world){target="_blank"} of GitHub's Quickstart Documentation. For now reading is fine. You do not necessarily have to work through the tutorial.  
2) [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}.
3) [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target="_blank"}. [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git){target="_blank"} is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your machine.
4) Open R Studio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Git / SVN: check "enable version control" and set the path to the git.exe (e.g. C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe). Restart RStudio.
5) [Create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo){target="_blank"} on GitHub. Skip section 'Commit your first changes'. 
6) By default, your repository has one branch named `main`. Create an additional branch off the `main` and call this new branch `dev`. To do so, follow the instructions in the [Hello-World-Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world){target="_blank"}.

```

As next step, you will have to install the `rmarkdown` library as well as `tinytex` in RStudio as described in the [RMarkdown Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html){target="_blank"}. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

In order to correctly install `tinytex`, make sure to execute both lines in RStudio:
  
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

RStudio may call for the installation of dependencies. Follow the instructions and install the requested libraries. In case you are facing any technical issues, please turn to the discussion forum!

## Create a local clone

In order to locally work on your repository contents, you will have to create a local clone of your online GitHub repository.

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

In RStudio: File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> Git.

Copy/past the Repository URL (go to your Online repository to find URL), browse local directory and `Create Project` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-clone)).

```

```{r L09-clone, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Clone GitHub Repository", out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Gitclone.png')
```

Once you have cloned the online repository, the file contents of the repository as well as a new tab called `Git` appears in RStudio (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-features)).

```{r L09-features, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="New features in RStudio", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/NewFeatures.png')
```

Per default the repository contains three files: 

1) [`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore){target="_blank"}
2) An [RStudio Project File](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects){target="_blank"} (.Rproj) 
3) A [ReadmMe File](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes){target="_blank"} (.md = pure markdown)

[`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore){target="_blank"} and the [RStudio Project File](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects){target="_blank"} were created on project initialization, meaning that these files are new and not yet available in the online repository. Changes made to the original repository are listed in the `Git tab` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-changes)). 

```{r L09-changes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Changes in Git tab", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Changes.png')
```

Before we further modify our repository, switch to the `dev` branch (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-branch)). At the moment `dev` branch and `main` branch are identical.

```{r L09-branch, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Switch branch", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Branches.png')
```

```{block2, type = 'rmdtip'}

It his highly recommended to keep work in progress seperate from the `main` branch by working in a seperate developer branch. Later on, we will merge our changes from `dev` into the `main` branch.

```

## Create a first RMarkdown document

Now that the environment is set up, we can create a first simple RMarkdown document. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

In RStudio: File -> New File -> R Markdown....

Type in a title, keep the default settings and confirm with `OK`. As a result you get a minimal RMarkdown sample file, with the file extension `.Rmd`.

```

As apparent from the sample file, RMarkdown documents are composed of the three basic components **metadata**, **text** and **code** (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-sample)). 

```{r L09-sample, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMarkdown sample file", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/SampleFile.png')
```

The syntax for the metadata is [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML){target="_blank"}. In  our document, the metadata section specifies the title of the document, the output format and the date of creation. A large number of other document properties can be specified in this section. [Here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ymlthis/vignettes/yaml-overview.html){target="_blank"} you can find an overview of the basic YAML syntax.    

After the metadata section an **R inline code block** starts and ends with backticks. The three parameters in curly brackets identify the code as R code. `setup` is the name of the code block and (as we will see later) `include=FALSE` prevents code and code results from being displayed in the compiled HTML output. Nevertheless, RMarkdown still runs the code in this block.  The inline code block as such sets `echo=TRUE` as default option for all code chunks in the document, which prevents code, but not the results from being displayed.    

The other code blocks in the `.Rmd` document produce a summary output (see lines 7-19) or create a simple scatterplot (see lines 25-27). To see how the compiled HTML output looks like, click `Knit` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-knit)).

```{r L09-knit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Knit HTML Output ", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/knit.png')
```

Alternatively, you may click on the dropdown arrow next to the `Knit` button and compile `PDF` or `.docx` outputs. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Please take your time to understand how the `.Rmd` syntax translates into an output. For instances, to bold text, you can add two astersisks before and after a word or phrase.  

```

## Synchronize with GitHub

It is good practice to synchronize changes made to the project on a regular basis with the online repository. First, we need to pull changes that someone else could have made in the meantime.   

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Click the `Pull button` in the `Git tab` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-pull)). A message appears indicating that no other changes have been made (`Already up to date`).

```

```{r L09-pull, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Make Pull", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pull.png')
```

Even if you work on your own, it is advisable to routinely start the sync process with a `Pull`. 

Before you can push your own changes to the online repository, you have to `Commit` changes. Committing is like in-process saving. The `Commit` takes a snapshot of your changes. This snapshot is combined with a user defined commit message. 

```{block2, type = 'rmdexercise'}

Locally save all documents in RStudio. Click the `Commit button` in the `Git tab` . Those files that are affected by changes are listed in the commit window. You can click on one of the files. The changes will be displayed (green is new, red is deleted content).

Manually select all files by clicking the respective checkboxes. In order to make sure that you have not missed a file, you may execute `git add -A` in the terminal window to add all files to the commit. Once this is done, enter a meaningful commit message that describes your revision and push the `Commit button`. 

See Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-commit)

```

```{r L09-commit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Make Commit", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/commit.png')
```

To finish the sync process, click the `Push button` in the `Git tab` (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-push)). 

```{r L09-push, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Make Push", out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Push.png')
```

Your online repository should now be updated (switch to `dev` branch in your repository) (see Fig. \@ref(fig:L09-updated)).

```{r L09-updated, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Commit with message 'decribe sync process in github' was pushed to the developer branch a minute ago", out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/CommitFinished.png')
```
