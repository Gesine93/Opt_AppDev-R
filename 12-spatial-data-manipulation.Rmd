# New Chapter: **Spatial Data Manipulation (see modified chapters)**
- Focus on **key skills** for **spatial data wrangling**:
    - Filtering **`sf`** objects and rasters based on conditions.
    - **Conducting spatial joins** and **geometric** operations (e.g., intersect, buffer).
- **Investigate** which packages (e.g., **`terra`**, **`sfdep`**) excel in specific spatial operations.
